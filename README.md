##  Overview

This system allows founders and executives to ask questions like:

-  “What’s our current weighted pipeline?”
-  “How much revenue is closing this month?”
-  “Which work orders are delayed?”
-  “What are our operational bottlenecks?”

The agent autonomously:

- Breaks down complex queries
- Selects the correct data source
- Calls live Monday.com APIs
- Computes raw facts
- Formats a clean executive summary



#  Key Capabilities

### Intelligent Query Decomposition
Breaks complex business questions into structured sub-queries using a Pydantic schema.

###  Accurate BI Computation
Pulls live data from Monday.com and computes real metrics.

###  Multi-Board Intelligence
Understands relationships between:
- Sales Pipeline (Deals Board)
- Work Orders Tracker
- Revenue & Operational Metrics

###  Executive-Ready Output
Returns beautifully formatted Markdown summaries:
- Bold KPIs
- Bullet points
- Clean sections
- Data Caveats
